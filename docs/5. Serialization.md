# My AI experiments: Serialization
## 

This article is part of a series on my [AI experiments](https://medium.com/@geertvandamme/61757b11c902)....

- Serialization issue
* classical NN (fully connected layers) are very easy to serialize
* https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/gguf
* https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gguf-versus-ggml
* When we allow more complex architectures
    * unknown territory
    * brain similarity
    * GPU and matrix library issues
    * serialization
* cloning conflicts with learning / individualization of parallel clones
* cloning - highly parallel computing
* Brain copy
